# Crucible — Backlog

The single source of truth for what's built and what's next. Built the way we build:
V1 is the **MVP** — the smallest *complete*, production-quality whole on one code
path (not a cut-corner prototype), every default maintained (100% coverage, CI gate,
docs move with code). Then the fun.

Each backlog item below has **What / Why / How** — the *How* is written to
junior-dev detail: the files to touch, the approach, and the gotchas (especially the
determinism contract and security).

---

## V1 — the MVP ✅ complete

- [x] **Core** (`env.py`, `trajectory.py`, `rollout.py`): the `Environment` contract,
      the replayable `Trajectory`, `rollout` (record), `replay` (verify).
- [x] **Example environments** (`envs/`): `GuessEnv` (deterministic replay proof),
      `SQLTaskEnv` (wrap real SQLite → verifiable reward), `CodeTaskEnv` (the test
      suite *is* the reward function).
- [x] **Persistence** (`trajectory.py`): `save`/`load` with a versioned JSON
      envelope.
- [x] **CLI** (`cli.py`): `crucible show <file>` — summarize + integrity-check.
- [x] **CI + coverage gate** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): pytest ≥90% on 3.11–3.13.

See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) for how all of the above works.

## Then the fun (post-V1)

Ordered by leverage. Each rides on the solid V1.

### 1. Sandbox the code grader ✅ done  ·  *the public-flip gate*

Shipped in `crucible/sandbox.py`: a `Sandbox` seam (`run(files, command) ->
GradeResult`), a `SubprocessSandbox` adapter (materialize to a temp dir, run the
command in a subprocess with a minimal environment, `PYTHONHASHSEED=0`, and a hard
timeout — fail closed on timeout / crash / launch error), and `command_grader`, which
turns a sandboxed command into a `CodeTaskEnv` grader in one line. The agent's code
now runs in a *child process*, not ours. Proven: pass/fail, a looping submission
contained by timeout, a bad binary → grade-not-crash, and a full episode replays
byte-for-byte through the sandbox. 100% covered. *Second adapter (container /
seccomp / nsjail) slots behind the same seam when it's needed.*

### 2. Training export  ·  *the adoption keystone*  ·  *core done; trainer adapter open*

- [x] **Format-agnostic core** — `crucible/export.py`: `to_records(traj)` flattens a
      trajectory into `{env_id, seed, step, prompt, completion, reward}` records (the
      per-step triple every RL trainer wants); `write_jsonl(trajs, path)` writes a
      training dataset. A `render_observation` / `render_action` hook turns rich
      dict observations into the text a trainer expects (default: strings as-is,
      else canonical JSON). Plain dicts/JSONL ⇒ zero dependency. 100% covered.
- [ ] **Trainer-specific adapter** — a thin, optional-extra mapping from these
      neutral records onto a concrete schema (TRL `GRPOTrainer` dataset / verifiers /
      prime-rl), pinned against that trainer's *current* API, installed via
      `crucible-rl[trl]` so the core stays zero-dep. Done when a Crucible trajectory
      drives a minimal real training run in an example.

### 3. Environment registry + `crucible replay <file>` ✅ done

Shipped: `crucible/registry.py` (`register(name)` decorator, `make(name, config)`,
`registered()`); `Environment.config()` returns a serializable reconstruction dict;
`rollout` records `env_config` on the trajectory; the on-disk format is now **v2**
(v1 still loads, `env_config` defaults empty); `crucible replay <file>` rebuilds the
env with `make` and re-runs it, printing an OK or the itemized mismatches. `GuessEnv`
and `SQLTaskEnv` are registered; `CodeTaskEnv` (live grader) is library-replayable but
not CLI-replayable, and the CLI says so. 100% covered.

### 4. Crucible Space  ·  *the 1am-star demo*

- **What.** A Hugging Face Space where you drop an agent into an environment in the
  browser and watch it get scored and replayed.
- **Why.** Visibility. Environments aren't yet a first-class HF artifact — this stakes
  the claim.
- **How.** A small Gradio app (`spaces/` dir, separate from the packaged core):
  pick an env, step an agent, render the trajectory, hit "replay" and show the
  `ReplayReport` going green. Reuses `rollout`/`replay` unchanged.

### 5. More environment wrappers  ·  *CLI done; HTTP + git-repo open*

- [x] **Subprocess/CLI env** — `envs/command.py` `CommandEnv`: the agent emits a
      command (argv), reward is exit-0 **and** stdout matches expected. Reuses the
      sandbox, is registerable + CLI-replayable (whole config is data), replays
      byte-for-byte. 100% covered.
- [ ] **HTTP/API env** — wrap a service. **Gotcha:** the hardest to make
      deterministic (external state); start with a recorded/mock backend and document
      the caveat honestly (`replay` will expose any drift).
- [ ] **git-repo-with-pytest env** — a real repo whose reward is `pytest` going green,
      built on `CodeTaskEnv` + the sandbox (`command_grader(["python","-m","pytest",
      "-q"])`). The SWE-agent shape at full scale.
- **Why.** Reach — each wrapper turns a whole class of existing software into
  environments with near-zero code. Pattern is always the same: `reset` fixes initial
  state, `step` applies the action to the real system, reward is a programmatic check.

### 6. Reward composition (rubrics) ✅ done

Shipped: `crucible/reward.py` — `rubric(("name", weight, check), ...)` builds a
`Rubric`; `score(state) -> (float, breakdown)` returns the weighted fraction passed
in [0, 1] plus a per-criterion `name → passed` map for `info`. Validated (non-empty,
non-negative weights, positive total). An environment scores partial credit in `step`
and still replays byte-for-byte (proven). Stays strictly programmatic — learned
reward for non-verifiable tasks remains parked (see below). 100% covered.

### 7. The trajectory commons

- **What.** Trajectories as shareable, versioned datasets ("GitHub for agent
  experience").
- **Why.** The network-effect endgame: a growing library of open, *auditable*
  episodes (auditable because replay makes the reward checkable — the thing no
  trace-dataset today offers).
- **How.** A `crucible push/pull` that reads/writes the versioned trajectory format
  to/from an HF dataset repo (via `huggingface_hub`, an optional extra). Ship a
  dataset card template that records the env, the seed, and the fingerprint.

---

## Not yet (parked deliberately)

- **Learned reward for non-verifiable tasks.** The genuinely hard frontier (support,
  RAG, open-ended work). Stay programmatic until it's designed carefully — a bad
  learned reward is worse than no environment. Also watch the provenance boundary:
  "grade the quality of an agent's judgment" drifts toward the excluded field.
- **Publishing / licensing.** Repo is local. When it opens: Apache-2.0 (adoption) vs.
  BSL (protect the hosted business) vs. dual — decided at publication.
